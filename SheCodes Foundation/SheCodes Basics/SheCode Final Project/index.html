        We import highly pedigree breed of dogs from South Africa. Some of which
        are the indigenous South African Boerboel, labradors, pugs, blue eyes
        Siberian Huskies, and lots more. On receipt of payment, we carry you
        through the entire process of selecting and buying your new FURiend. We
        will update you through the process of applying for your pets travel
        documents. And once we secure a booking for your pet with the airline,
        you will be notified, so you can meet your new FURiend at the airport in
        Lagos or any other airport in Nigeria of your choice.
